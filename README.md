# BKMS ‚Üî Coda Attendance Automation Bot

This project automates the process of syncing attendance from a Coda-based roster to the BKMS (BAPS Kishore Management System) website using a full-stack solution with React, FastAPI, Selenium, and Coda API.

üîç Overview
	‚Ä¢	üß† Purpose: Eliminate manual entry by pulling attendance data from Coda, determining who attended a sabha, and auto-filling the BKMS form with the correct kishores marked.
	‚Ä¢	‚Üª Flow:
	1.	User selects sabha group, date (restricted to recent Sundays), and setup options.
	2.	Bot fetches attendance from Coda for the selected sabha and date.
	3.	Bot opens BKMS and automates the submission of attendance using Selenium.
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You must manually complete the CAPTCHA within 30 seconds once BKMS loads, or the automation will fail.
	4.	Telegram notification confirms successful submission.
